INTRODUCTION

I needed to automate the sending of the mail for my company and I also needed to create my first script to present it during my System and Network Technician final. 
This script basically take the email address and name registered in the excel file that we have choose and send a email to each people. This is a very easy script and a good one if you start in Python as you're using fonctionality such as loops, libraries and parameters in a very easy and comprehensible way. 

Hope you will enjoy this scrit as I did !
